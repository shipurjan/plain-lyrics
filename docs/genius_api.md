### Registering Your Application

First, visit the Genius [API Client management page](http://genius.com/api-clients) and create an API client for your application. This will provide you with a **`client_id`** and a **`client_secret`** that you'll use to identify your application to Genius. The **`redirect_uri`** is used for authenticating Genius users with your application. You can change it later. The API Client will belong to the user account signed in to Genius when it's created.

### Making Requests

The available endpoints are listed below in the resources section, along with embedded examples showing how they work and what they return.

Genius uses OAuth2 for authentication. All API requests must be authenticated. There are plenty of libraries available to help with this part of your integration. There's also a [detailed guide below](https://docs.genius.com/#/authentication-h1) if you're committed to implementing it yourself.

# Resources

## Annotations

An **annotation** is a piece of content about a part of a document. The document may be a *song* (hosted on Genius) or a *web page* (hosted anywhere). The part of a document that an annotation is attached to is called a *referent*.

Annotation data returned from the API includes both the substance of the annotation and the necessary information for displaying it in its original context.

## Referents

**Referents** are the sections of a piece of content to which *annotations* are attached. Each referent is associated with a *web page* or a *song* and may have one or more annotations. Referents can be searched by the document they are attached to or by the user that created them.

When a new annotation is created either a referent is created with it or that annotation is attached to an existing referent.

# Authentication

> **Access for Apps Without Users**
> If your application doesn't include user-specific behaviors you can use the *client* access token associated with your API instead of tokens for authenticated users. These tokens are only valid for read-only endpoints that are not restricted by a [required scope](https://docs.genius.com/#/available-scopes).
>
> You can get a client access token by clicking "Generate Access Token" on the API Client management page.

Genius uses the OAuth2 standard for making API calls on behalf of individual users. Requests are authenticated with an **Access Token** sent in an HTTP header (or as a request parameter if you must).

All interaction with the API must be done over HTTPS.

> An example request would look like this:

> ```
> https://api.genius.com/oauth/authorize?
> client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&
> redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&
> scope=REQUESTED_SCOPE&
> state=SOME_STATE_VALUE&
> response_type=code
>
> ```

### Getting an Access Token

Start by directing a user of your application to Genius's authentication page at `https://api.genius.com/oauth/authorize` with the following query parameters:

* **`client_id`**: Your application's Client ID, as listed on the API Client management page
* **`redirect_uri`**: The URI Genius will redirect the user to after they've authorized your application; it must be the same as the one set for the API client on the management page
* **`scope`**: The permissions your application is requesting as a space-separated list (see [available scopes](https://docs.genius.com/#/available-scopes) below)
* **`state`**: A value that will be returned with the code redirect for maintaining arbitrary state through the authorization process
* **`response_type`**: Always "code"

> **More About State**
> One important use for this value is increased securityâ€”by including a unique, difficult to guess value (say, a hash of a user session value), potential attackers can be prevented from sending phony redirects to your app.

On the authentication page the user can choose to allow your application to access Genius on their behalf. They'll be asked to sign in (or, if necessary, create an account) first. Then the user is redirected to `https://YOUR_REDIRECT_URI/?code=CODE&state=SOME_STATE_VALUE`.

Your application can exchange the `code` query parameter from the redirect for an access token by making a `POST` request to `https://api.genius.com/oauth/token` with the following request body data:

```
{
  "code": "CODE_FROM_REDIRECT",
  "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "redirect_uri": "YOUR_REDIRECT_URI",
  "response_type": "code",
  "grant_type": "authorization_code"
}

```

* **`code`**: The `code` query parameter from the redirect to your `redirect_uri`
* **`client_secret`**: Your application's Client Secret, as listed on the API Client management page
* **`grant_type`**: Aways "authorization\_code"
* **`client_id`**: As above
* **`redirect_uri`**: As above
* **`response_type`**: As above

Most of these are the same values as used in the initial request.

```
{
  "access_token": "ACCESS_TOKEN"
}

```

The response body will be an object with the token as the value for the `access_token` key. Save the token and use it to make requests on behalf of the authorizing user.

Building a client-only application?

An alternative authentication flow is available for browser-based, client-only applications. *This mechanism is much less secure than the full code exchange process and should only be used by applications without a server or native platform to execute the full code flow.*

Where "code" is used as the `response_type` value in the instructions above, use `token`. Instead of being redirected with a code that your application exchanges for an access token, the user is redirected to `https://REDIRECT_URI/#access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN&state=STATE`. Extract the access token from the URL hash fragment and use it to make requests.

With the token response type, the user's access token is exposed in the browser, where it could be accessed by malicious JavaScript or otherwise intercepted much more easily than when it's only exchanged between servers. The client secret isn't used, so it's much easier for potential attackers to fake authorization requests. Don't use the token flow if you don't have to.

### Available Scopes

Access tokens can only be used for resources that are covered by the scopes provided when they created. These are the available scopes and the endpoints they grant permission for:

| Scope | Endpoints |
| --- | --- |
| `me` | [`GET /account`](https://docs.genius.com/#account-show) |
| `create_annotation` | [`POST /annotations`](https://docs.genius.com/#annotations-create) |
| `manage_annotation` | [`PUT /annotations/:id`](https://docs.genius.com/#annotations-update)   [`DELETE /annotations/:id`](https://docs.genius.com/#annotations-destroy) |
| `vote` | [`PUT /annotations/:id/upvote`](https://docs.genius.com/#annotations-upvote)   [`PUT /annotations/:id/downvote`](https://docs.genius.com/#annotations-downvote)   [`PUT /annotations/:id/unvote`](https://docs.genius.com/#annotations-unvote) |

### Using An Access Token

```
GET /some-endpoint HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: CompuServe Classic/1.22
Accept: application/json
Host: api.genius.com
Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN

```

To make authenticated requests with an access token, include it in an HTTP `Authorization` header preceded by the word "Bearer" and a space. For example, the value of the header could be `Bearer 1234tokentokentoken`.

Passing the token in the authorization header is the preferred way to authenticate API requests. However, the API also supports providing the token as the `access_token` query parameter of a `GET` request or element of a `POST` body.

# Response Format

```
GET https://api.genius.com/web_pages/lookup?canonical_url=http://example.com

```

```
{
  "meta": {
    "status": 200
  },
  "response": {
    "web_page": {
      "annotation_count":7,
      "id": 1480,
      ...
    }
  }
}

```

All Genius API responses are JSON. Every JSON response has a `meta` field with a `status` value that is an integer representation of the HTTP status code for the response.

For successful requests, there is also a top-level `response` field which will be a nested object. For example, a request for details about annotations on a web page:

### Errors

```
GET https://api.genius.com/apples

```

```
{
  "meta": {
    "status": 404,
    "message": "Not found"
  }
}

```

If a request fails or errors (i.e. the `status` values is 4xx or 5xx). the `meta` field will also have a `message` value that is a string with details about the error. For example, a request to a non-existent API endpoint:

### Text Formatting (`text_format` option)

```
{
  "plain": "A hilarious word!",
  "html": "<p>A hilarious word!</p>",
  "dom": {
    "tag": "root",
    "children": [ {
      "tag": "p",
      "children": [ "A hilarious word!" ]
    } ]
  }
}

```

Many API requests accept a `text_format` query parameter that can be used to specify how text content is formatted. The value for the parameter must be one or more of `plain`, `html`, and `dom`. The value returned will be an object with key-value pairs of formats and results:

* **`plain`** is just plain text, no markup
* **`html`** is a string of unescaped HTML suitable for rendering by a browser
* **`dom`** is a nested object representing and HTML DOM hierarchy that can be used to programmatically present structured content
